# Other Symbols

A few symbol identifiers also have a special meaning and can't be used as such. These include

* `=`
* `.` and `:`
* `,` and `;`
* `#`
* `@`
* `_`
* `...`
* `<-`, `->` and `=>`

# Brackets and Parenthesis

Dyvil supports three types of brackets and parenthesis, all of which are paired with their respective counterparts.

* `(` and `)`
* `[` and `]`
* `{` and `}`

In some special contexts, the less-than `<` and greater-than `>` symbols are also used as brackets. These are also referred to as Angle Brackets.
