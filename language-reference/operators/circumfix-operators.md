# Circumfix Operators

These operators consist of two symbols that combine to a single operation with one operand. A common example in math is the absolute value or magniture operator `|x|`. Circumfix operators are declared using the `prefix` and `postfix` keyword and do not require addition specifiers like precedence or associativity.

```swift
prefix postfix operator | |
```
