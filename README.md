**Dyvil** is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM.
It is compiled, statically and strongly typed and supports object-oriented, functional and imperative
programming styles. The modern and extensible syntax is based on Swift, Kotlin and Scala.

As a new programming language in active development, the main goals of the Dyvil project are the following:

- to provide modern syntax and semantics
- to avoid common boilerplate code
- to achieve performance comparable to Java programs
- to be fully compatible and interoperable with Java and other JVM languages like Scala, Kotlin or Groovy

In addition to the **Dyvil-to-JVM-Bytecode compiler**, the toolchain consists of an executable **REPL**, a full-fledged
**standard library** including an extensive collection framework, the **Dyvil Property Format** library and
specification, and the **GenSrc** source code generation and text template specialization tool. Information on all components as well as the language itself can be found in this language reference.
