The Dyvil Language Reference
============================

Dyvil is an object-oriented general-purpose programming language with functional and imperative elements. It has a C-descendant syntax and bases on Java and the JVM. Dyvil extends the language with new and modern language features.

Some of the language's aims are:

- to **enhance** Java with modern programming language elements
- to **avoid** common boilerplate code
- to **give** programmers full **control** over the syntax and semantics of their code
- to be fully **compatible** and **inter-operable** with Java and other JVM languages (e.g. Scala, Groovy, etc.)

This documentation describes the syntax and semantics of new and old language elements. It includes both a beginner guide and a more detailed language reference.
