The Dyvil Language Reference
=======

Dyvil is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM. It extends the language with several new features including operator overloading, function types, tuples and many more.

Dyvil is a C-descendant object-oriented programming language with functional and imperative elements. Some of the language's aims are:

- to **enhance** Java with modern programming language elements
- to **avoid** common boilerplate code
- to **give** the programmer full **control** over the syntax and semantics of his or her code
- to be fully **compatible** and **inter-operable** with Java and other JVM languages (e.g. Scala, Groovy, etc.)

This documentation will guide you through all the new and old language features of the programming language.
